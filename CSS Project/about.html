        The Table, one of Indiaâ€™s most celebrated restaurants, has welcomed
        guests to enjoy its globally inspired cuisine and hospitality since
        opening in 2011. Located in the iconic Colaba area of Mumbai, The Table
        has been a trailblazer within the national restaurant community. From
        introducing the concept of small and large plates to providing a true
        farm to table experience with produce from its own farm, The Table
        continues to be at the forefront of Indian hospitality. With an
        ingredient-driven focus, global accents and nuances, the menu is a
        commitment to simplicity and purity of flavour, a philosophy inherited
        from San Francisco.
      </p>
      <p>
        The menu is an expression of the finest available vegetables, meat and
        fish, nearly all of which we procure locally and at the peak of the
        season. The Table draws inspiration from each corner of the globe, from
        America, Italy, and France, to China, Thailand, Japan, and beyond.
        Utilizing these influences, we offer a dynamic menu thus creating a
        diverse and exciting experience for our guests.
